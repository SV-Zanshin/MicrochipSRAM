# MicrochipSRAM library
*Arduino* library which defines methods for accessing any the Microchip SRAM and SNVRAM SPI family memory chips. The get() and put() methods allow any data type to be written with one call and the library automagically detects which of the possible memory chips is in use. 
The following Microchip **SRAM** and **SNVRAM** chips can be accessed using this library:

* 23x640		(64kbit)
* 23x256		(256kbit)
* 23x512		(512kbit)
* 23x1024		(1024kbit)
* 23LCV512	(512kbit)
* 23LCV1024	(1024kbit)
